How are the tasks organized?
Application -> Profile -> taskList

taskList contains all the different tasks the User does
the tasks are classes themselves which hold the log data.

should the tasks split the (time,duration,desc) into separate arrayLists? or a single arraylist with type arrayList




Tasks should pertain to AN INDIVIDUAL, however when in another profile allow suggestions (pulls tasks from other users on device)

Tasks should contain the following:
    Name of task
    Date & time
    duration


when a task is created, create a 'window' for it to allow for easy logging
a task 'window' allows the user to see all the times logged for a particular task
there is a generic window that allows the user to see ALL logged items, but for ^^^ allow for filtering (use checkboxes)

for daily/just reoccuring items, allow user to just select a checkbox to mark as done (you dont need to time yourself everytime you complete the task yknow)

Calendar window that shows you when you (by day) you did tasks/things (tasks could be highlighted in a certain color which a small rectangle or box of that color is encased in the calendar)

Table view???
    allows for EASY LOGGING AND TASK CREATION
    looks like the "monthly ticket" you keep making and the program can grade you weekly/monthly/yearly (really interesting usecase)


Profile contains
    First, Last
    email
    pfp? (can add later)
    bio


windows are just TEMPLATES for the profiles (all menus for the profiles should be identical, only the data is changed)


Log window, tasklist window SHOULD BE OF SAME TYPE
(they are subwindows in main frame ‘mainframe 𒅒𒈔𒅒𒇫𒄆👨🏻‍💻’)
Should be resizeable and selectable through a button toggle on the (top-bar?? A side-bar??)
Main window with inherited subwindows classes subwindows should be contained WITHIN main window and should have bounding/snapping properties near main window border
